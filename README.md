# Auction

An auction system on servaral server nodes.


## Deployment

To run our project and create three servers run:

```bash
  go run launch.go server
```
in three different terminals, to create the replicas.

When it's successfully set up, open a new terminal and run:

```bash
  go run launch.go client
```

You can open as many clients as you like, just make sure you have a terminal for each of them. ðŸ’ª

When you have the desired number of clients, you can place bets by typing the desired bid you want to place such as: 

```bash
  300
```
or ask for the state of the auction writing:

```bash
  result
```

Happy auctioning. ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘Œ
